# Predicting Newly Listed Cryptocurrencies Pump & Dump Schemes on Binance Using Python
This is a capstone project for my DataScience Bootcamp at BrainStation Vancouver. The hypothesis is that newly listed cryptocurrencies on Binance will have a pump and dump scheme within the initial 90-day period based on the movement of BTCUSDT. The model will predict the percentage of pump before it happens.
